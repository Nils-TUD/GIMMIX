@* Introduction. This program is the heart of the meta-simulator for the
ultra-configurable \MMIX\ pipeline: It defines the |MMIX_run| routine, which
does most of the
work. Another routine, |MMIX_init|, is also defined here, and so is a header
file called \.{mmix\_pipe.h}. The header file is used by the main routine and
by other routines like |MMIX_config|, which are compiled separately.

Readers of this program should be familiar with the explanation of \MMIX\
architecture as presented in the main program module for {\mc MMMIX}.

A lot of subtle things can happen when instructions are executed in parallel.
Therefore this simulator ranks among the most interesting and instructive
programs in the author's experience. The author has tried his best to make
everything correct \dots\ but the chances for error are great. Anyone who
discovers a bug is therefore urged to report it as soon as possible to
\.{knuth-bug@@cs.stanford.edu}; then the program will be as useful as
possible. Rewards will be paid to bug-finders! (Except for bugs in version~0.)

It sort of boggles the mind when one realizes that the present program might
someday be translated by a \CEE/~compiler for \MMIX\ and used to simulate
{\it itself}.

@ This high-performance prototype of \MMIX\ achieves its efficiency by
means of ``pipelining,'' a technique of overlapping that is explained
for the related \.{DLX} computer in Chapter~3 of Hennessy \char`\&\ Patterson's
book {\sl Computer Architecture\/} (second edition). Other techniques
such as ``dynamic scheduling'' and ``multiple issue,'' explained in
Chapter~4 of that book, are used too.

One good way to visualize the procedure is to imagine that somebody has
organized a high-tech car repair shop according to similar principles.
There are eight independent functional units, which we can think of as
eight groups of auto mechanics, each specializing in a particular task;
each group has its own workspace with room to deal with one car at a time.
Group~F (the ``fetch'' group) is in charge of rounding up customers and
getting them to enter the assembly-line garage in an orderly fashion.
Group~D (the ``decode and dispatch'' group) does the initial vehicle
inspection and
writes up an order that explains what kind of servicing is required.
The vehicles go next to one of the four ``execution'' groups:
Group~X handles routine maintenance, while groups XF, XM, and XD are
specialists in more complex tasks that tend to take longer. (The XF
people are good at floating the points, while the XM and XD groups are
experts in multilink suspensions and differentials.) When the relevant X~group
has finished its work, cars drive to M~station, where they send or receive
messages and possibly pay money to members of the ``memory'' group. Finally
all necessary parts are installed by members of group~W, the ``write''
group, and the car leaves the shop. Everything is tightly organized so
that in most cases the cars move in synchronized fashion from station
to station, at regular 100-nanocentury intervals. % about 5.3 minutes

In a similar way, most \MMIX\ instructions can be handled in a five-stage
pipeline, F--D--X--M--W, with X replaced by XF for floating-point
addition or conversion, or by XM for multiplication, or by XD for
division or square root. Each stage ideally takes one clock cycle,
although XF, XM, and (especially) XD are slower. If the instructions enter
in a suitable pattern, we might see one instruction being fetched,
another being decoded, and up to four being executed, while another is accessing
memory, and yet another is finishing up by writing new information into
registers; all this is going on simultaneously during one clock cycle. Pipelining
with eight separate stages might therefore make the machine run
up to 8 times as fast as it could if each instruction were being dealt with
individually and without overlap. (Well, perfect speedup turns out to
be impossible, because of the shared M and~W stages; the theory of
knapsack programming, to be discussed in Section~7.7 of {\sl The Art
of Computer Programming}, tells us that the maximal achievable speedup is
at most $8-1/p-1/q-1/r$ when XF, XM, and~XD have delays bounded by $p$,
$q$, and~$r$ cycles. But we can achieve a factor of more than~7
if we are very lucky.)

Consider, for example, the \.{ADD} instruction. This instruction enters
the computer's processing unit in F stage, taking only one clock cycle if
it is in the cache of instructions recently seen. Then the D~stage
recognizes the command as an \.{ADD} and acquires the current values
of \$Y and \$Z; meanwhile, of course, another instruction is being fetched
by~F.
On the next clock cycle, the X stage adds the values together.
This prepares the way for the M stage to watch for overflow and to
get ready for any exceptional action that might be needed with respect
to the settings of special register~rA\null.
Finally, on the fifth clock cycle, the sum is either written into~\$X
or the trip handler for integer overflow is invoked.
Although this process has taken five clock
cycles (that is, $5\upsilon$),
the net increase in running time has been only~$1\upsilon$.

Of course congestion can occur, inside a computer as in a repair shop.
For example, auto parts might not be readily available; or a car might
have to sit in D station while waiting to move to XM, thereby blocking
somebody else from moving from F to~D.  Sometimes there won't
necessarily be a steady stream of customers.  In such cases the
employees in some parts of the shop will occasionally be idle.  But we
assume that they always do their jobs as fast as possible, given the
sequence of customers that they encounter. With a clever person
setting up appointments---translation: with a clever
programmer and/or compiler arranging \MMIX\ instructions---the
organization can often be expected to run at nearly peak capacity.

In fact, this program is designed for experiments with many kinds of
pipelines, potentially using additional functional units (such as
several independent X~groups), and potentially fetching, dispatching, and
executing several nonconflicting instructions simultaneously.
Such complications
make this program more difficult than a simple pipeline simulator
would be, but they also make it a lot more instructive because we
can get a better understanding of the issues involved if we are
required to treat them in greater generality.

@ The data structures of this program are not precisely equivalent to
logical gates that could be implemented directly in silicon;
we will use data structures and
algorithms appropriate to the \CEE/ programming language. For example,
we'll use pointers and arrays, instead of buses and ports and latches. However,
the net effect of our data structures and algorithms is intended to
be equivalent to the net effect of a silicon implementation. The methods
used below are essentially equivalent to those used in real machines today,
except that diagnostic facilities are added so that we can readily
watch what is happening.

Each functional unit in the \MMIX\ pipeline is programmed here as a coroutine
in~\CEE/. At every clock cycle, we will call on each active coroutine to do one
phase of its operation; in terms of the repair-station analogy
described in the main program,
this corresponds to getting each group of
auto mechanics to do one unit of operation on a car.
The coroutines are performed sequentially, although
a real pipeline would have them act in parallel.
We will not ``cheat'' by letting one coroutine access a value early in its
cycle that another one computes late in its cycle, unless computer hardware
could ``cheat'' in an equivalent way.

@* Low-level routines. Where should we begin? It is tempting to start with a
global view of the simulator and then to break it down into component parts.
But that task is too daunting, because there are so many unknowns about what
basic ingredients ought to be combined when we construct the larger
components. So let us look first at the primitive operations on which
the superstructure will be built. Once we have created some infrastructure,
we'll be able to proceed with confidence to the larger tasks ahead.

@ This program for the 64-bit \MMIX\ architecture is based on 32-bit integer
arithmetic, because nearly every computer available to the author at the time
of writing (1998--1999) was limited in that way.
Details of the basic arithmetic appear in a separate program module
called {\mc MMIX-ARITH}, because the same routines are needed also
for the assembler and for the non-pipelined simulator. The
definition of type \&{tetra} should be changed, if necessary, to conform with
the definitions found there.

@* Coroutines. As stated earlier, this program can be regarded as a system of
interacting coroutines. Coroutines---sometimes called threads---are more or
less independent processes that share and pass data and control back and
forth. They correspond to the individual workers in an organization.

We don't need the full power of recursive coroutines, in which new threads are
spawned dynamically and have independent stacks for computation; we are, after
all, simulating a fixed piece of hardware. The total number of coroutines we
deal with is established once and for all by the |MMIX_config| routine, and
each coroutine has a fixed amount of local data.

The simulation operates one clock tick at a time, by executing all
coroutines scheduled for time~$t$ before advancing to time~$t+1$. The
coroutines at time~$t$ may decide to become dormant or they may reschedule
themselves and/or other coroutines for future times.

Each coroutine has a symbolic |name| for diagnostic purposes (e.g.,
\.{ALU1}); a nonnegative |stage| number (e.g., 2~for the second stage
of a pipeline); a pointer to the next coroutine scheduled at the same time (or
|NULL| if the coroutine is unscheduled); a pointer to a lock variable
(or |NULL| if no lock is currently relevant);
and a reference to a control block containing the data to be processed.

@s control_struct int

@<Type...@>=
typedef struct coroutine_struct {
 char *name; /* symbolic identification of a coroutine */
 int stage; /* its rank */
 struct coroutine_struct *next; /* its successor */
 struct coroutine_struct **lockloc; /* what it might be locking */
 struct control_struct *ctl; /* its data */

@.??@>
}

@ Coroutine control is masterminded by a ring of queues, one each for
times $t$, $t+1$, \dots, $t+|ring_size|-1$, when $t$ is the current
clock time.

All scheduling is first-come-first-served, except that coroutines with higher
|stage| numbers have priority. We want to process the later stages of a
pipeline first, in this sequential implementation, for the same reason that a
car must drive from M~station into W~station before another car can enter
M~station.

Each queue is a circular list of \&{coroutine} nodes, linked together by their
|next| fields. A list head~$h$ with |stage=max_stage| comes at the end and the
beginning of the queue. (All |stage| numbers of legitimate coroutines
are less than~|max_stage|.) The queued items are |h->next|, |h->next->next|,
etc., from back to front, and we have |c->stage<=c->next->stage| unless |c=h|.

Initially all queues are empty.

@ To schedule a coroutine |c| with positive delay |d<ring_size|, we call
|schedule(c,d,s)|. (The |s| parameter is used only if scheduling is
being logged; it does not affect the computation, but we will
generally set |s| to the state at which the scheduled coroutine will begin.)

@ The all-important |ctl| field of a coroutine, which contains the

The case |c->next=c| is also permitted; such a self-loop can occur when a
coroutine goes to sleep and expects to be awakened (that is, scheduled)
by another coroutine. Sleeping coroutines have important data in their
|ctl| field; they are therefore quite different from unscheduled
or ``unemployed'' coroutines, which have |c->next=NULL|. An unemployed
coroutine is not assumed to have any valid data in its |ctl| field.

@ When it is time to process all coroutines that have queued up for a
particular time~|t|, we empty the queue called |ring[t]| and link its items in
the opposite order (from front to back). The following subroutine uses the

@ Coroutines often start working on tasks that are {\it speculative}, in the
sense that we want certain results to be ready if they prove to be
useful; we understand that speculative computations might not actually
be needed. Therefore a coroutine might need to be aborted before it
has finished its work.

All coroutines must be written in such a way that important data structures
remain intact even when the coroutine is abruptly terminated. In particular,
we need to be sure that ``locks'' on shared resources are restored to
an unlocked state when a coroutine holding the lock is aborted.

A \&{lockvar} variable is |NULL| when it is unlocked; otherwise it
points to the coroutine responsible for unlocking~it.

}

@ Many of the quantities we deal with are speculative values
that might not yet have been certified as part of the ``real''
calculation; in fact, they might not yet have been calculated.

A \&{spec} consists of a 64-bit quantity |o| and a pointer~|p| to
a \&{specnode}. The value~|o| is meaningful only if the
pointer~|p| is~|NULL|; otherwise |p| points to a source of further information.

A \&{specnode} is a 64-bit quantity |o| together with links to other
\&{specnode}s
that are above it or below it in a doubly linked list. An additional
|known| bit tells whether the |o|~field has been calculated. There also is
a 64-bit |addr| field, to identify the list and give further information.
A \&{specnode} list keeps track of speculative values related to a specific
register or to all of main memory; we will discuss such lists in detail~later.

@ The analog of an automobile in our simulator is a block of data called
\&{control}, which represents all the relevant facts about an \MMIX\
instruction.  We can think of it as the work order attached to a car's
windshield. Each group of employees updates the work order as the car moves
through the shop.

A \&{control} record contains the original location of an instruction,
and its four bytes OP~X~Y~Z. An instruction has up to four inputs, which are
\&{spec} records called |y|, |z|, |b| and~|ra|; it also has up to three
outputs, which are \&{specnode} records called |x|, |a|, and~|rl|.
(We usually don't mention the special input~|ra| or the special output~|rl|,
which refer to \.{MMIX}'s internal registers rA and~rL.) For example, the
main inputs to a \.{DIVU} command are \$Y, \$Z, and~rD; the outputs are the
quotient~\$X and the remainder~rR. The inputs to a
\.{STO} command are \$Y, \$Z, and~\$X; there is one ``output,'' and
the field~|x.addr| will be set to the physical address of the memory location
corresponding to virtual address $\rm \$Y+\$Z$.

Each \&{control} block also points to the coroutine that owns it, if any.
And it has various other fields that contain other tidbits of information;
for example, we have already mentioned
the |state|~field, which often governs a coroutine's actions. The |i|~field,
which contains an internal operation code number, is generally used together
with |state| to switch between alternative computational steps. If, for
example, the |op|~field is \.{SUB} or \.{SUBI} or \.{NEG} or \.{NEGI},
the internal opcode~|i| will be simply~|sub|.
We shall define all the fields of \&{control} records
now and discuss them later.

An actual hardware implementation of \MMIX\ wouldn't need all the information
we are putting into a \&{control} block. Some of that information would
typically be latched between stages of a pipeline; other portions would
probably appear in so-called ``rename registers.''
@^rename registers@>
We simulate rename registers only indirectly,
by counting how many registers of that
kind would be in use if we were mimicking low-level hardware details more
precisely. The |go| field is a \&{specnode} for convenience in programming,
although we use only its |known| and |o| subfields. It generally contains
the address of the subsequent instruction.

@ And here is a (likewise boring) list of all the internal opcodes.
The smallest numbers, less than or equal to |max_pipe_op|, correspond
to operations for which arbitrary pipeline delays can be configured
with |MMIX_config|. The largest numbers, greater than |max_real_command|,
correspond to internally
generated operations that have no official OP code; for example,
there are internal operations to shift the $\gamma$ pointer in the
register stack, and to compute page table entries.

@ While we're into boring lists, we might as well define all the
special register numbers, together with an inverse table for
use in diagnostic outputs. These codes have been designed so that
special registers 0--7 are unencumbered, 8--11 can't be \.{PUT} by anybody,
12--18 can't be \.{PUT} by the user. Pipeline delays might occur
when \.{GET} is applied to special registers 21--31 or when
\.{PUT} is applied to special registers 15--20. The \.{SAVE} and
\.{UNSAVE} commands store and restore special registers 0--6 and 23--27.

@* Dynamic speculation.
Now that we understand some basic low-level structures,
we're ready to look at the larger picture.

This simulator is based on the idea of ``dynamic scheduling with register
renaming,'' as introduced in the 1960s by R.~M. Tomasulo [{\sl IBM Journal
@^Tomasulo, Robert Marco@>
of Research and Development\/ \bf11} (1967), 25--33]. Moreover, the dynamic
scheduling method is extended here to ``speculative execution,'' as
implemented in several processors of the 1990s and described in section~4.6 of
Hennessy and Patterson's {\sl Computer Architecture}, second edition (1995).
@^Hennessy, John LeRoy@>
@^Patterson, David Andrew@>
The essential idea is to keep track of the pipeline contents by recording all
dependencies between unfinished computations in a queue called the {\it
reorder buffer}. An entry in the reorder buffer might, for example, correspond
to an instruction that adds together two numbers whose values are still being
computed; those numbers have been allocated space in earlier positions of the
reorder buffer. The addition will take place as soon as both of its operands
are known, but the sum won't be written immediately into the destination
register. It will stay in the reorder buffer until reaching the {\it hot
seat\/} at the front of the queue. Finally, the addition leaves the
hot seat and is said to be {\it committed}.

Some instructions in the reorder buffer may in fact be executed only
on speculation, meaning that they won't really be called for unless a prior
branch instruction has the predicted outcome. Indeed, we can say that
all instructions not yet in the hot seat are being executed speculatively,
because an external interrupt might occur at any time and change the entire
course of computation. Organizing the pipeline as a reorder buffer allows us
to look ahead and keep busy computing values that have a good chance of being
needed later, instead of waiting for slow instructions or slow memory
references to be completed.

The reorder buffer is in fact a queue of \&{control} records, conceptually
forming part of a circle of such records inside the simulator, corresponding
to all instructions that have been dispatched or {\it issued\/} but not yet
committed, in strict program order.

The best way to get an understanding of speculative execution is perhaps to
imagine that the reorder buffer is large enough to hold hundreds of
instructions in various stages of execution, and to think of an implementation
of \MMIX\ that has dozens of functional units---more than would ever actually
@^thinking big@>
be built into a chip. Then one can readily visualize the kinds of control
structures and checks that must be made to ensure correct execution. Without
such a broad viewpoint, a programmer or hardware designer will be inclined to
think only of the simple cases and to devise algorithms that lack the proper
generality. Thus we have a somewhat paradoxical situation in which a difficult
general problem turns out to be easier to solve than its simpler special cases,
because it enforces clarity of thinking.

Instructions that have completed execution and have not yet been committed are
analogous to cars that have gone through our hypothetical repair shop and are
waiting for their owners to pick them up. However, all analogies break down,
and the world of automobiles does not have a natural counterpart for the
notion of speculative execution. That notion corresponds roughly to situations
in which people are led to believe that their cars need a new piece of
equipment, but they suddenly change their mind once they see the price tag,
and they insist on having the equipment removed even after it has been
partially or completely installed.

Speculatively executed instructions might make no sense: They might divide
by zero or refer to protected memory areas, etc. Such anomalies are not
considered catastrophic or even exceptional until the instruction reaches the
hot~seat.

The person who designs a computer with speculative execution is an optimist,
who has faith that the vast majority of the machine's predictions will come
true. The person who designs a reliable implementation of such a computer
is a pessimist, who understands that all predictions might come to naught. 
The pessimist does, however, take pains to optimize the cases that do turn out
well.

@ Let's consider what happens to a single instruction, say
\.{ADD} \.{\$1,\$2,\$3}, as it travels through the pipeline in a normal
situation. The first time this instruction is encountered, it is placed into
the I-cache (that is, the instruction cache), so that we won't have to access
memory when we need to perform it again. We will assume for simplicity in this
discussion that each I-cache access takes one clock cycle, although other
possibilities are allowed by |MMIX_config|.

Suppose the simulated machine fetches the example \.{ADD} instruction
at time 1000. Fetching is done by a coroutine whose |stage| number is~0.
A cache block typically contains 8 or 16 instructions. The fetch unit
of our machine is able to fetch up to |fetch_max| instructions on each clock
cycle and place them in the fetch buffer, provided that there is room in the
buffer and that all the instructions belong to the same cache block.

The dispatch unit of our simulator is able to issue up to |dispatch_max|
instructions on each clock cycle and move them from the fetch buffer to the
reorder buffer, provided that functional units are available for those
instructions and there is room in the reorder buffer. A functional unit that
handles \.{ADD} is usually called an ALU (arithmetic logic unit), and our
simulated machine might have several of them. If they aren't all stalled
in stage~1 of their pipelines, and if the reorder buffer isn't full, and if
the machine isn't in the process of deissuing instructions that were
mispredicted, and if
fewer than |dispatch_max| instructions are ahead of the \.{ADD} in the fetch
buffer, and if all such prior instructions can be issued without using up all
the free ALUs, our \.{ADD} instruction will be issued at time 1001.
(In fact, all of these conditions are usually true.)

We assume that $\rm L>3$, so that \$1, \$2, and~\$3 are local registers.
For simplicity we'll assume in fact that the register stack is empty, so that
the \.{ADD} instruction is supposed to set $\rm l[1]\gets l[2]+l[3]$. The
operands l[2] and~l[3] might not be known at time 1001; they are \&{spec}
values, which might point to \&{specnode} entries in the reorder buffer for
previous instructions whose destinations are l[2] and~l[3].
The dispatcher fills the next available control block of the reorder buffer
with information for the \.{ADD}, containing appropriate \&{spec} values
corresponding to l[2] and~l[3] in its |y| and~|z| fields. The |x|~field of
this control block will be inserted into a doubly linked list of \&{specnode}
records, corresponding to l[1] and to all instructions in the reorder buffer
that have l[1] as a destination. The boolean value |x.known| will be set to
|false|, meaning that this speculative value still needs to be
computed. Subsequent instructions that need l[1] as a source will point to
|x|, if they are issued before the sum |x.o| has been computed. Double
linking is used in the \&{specnode} list because the \.{ADD} instruction might
be cancelled before it is finally committed; thus deletions might occur
at either end of the list for~l[1].

At time 1002, the ALU handling the \.{ADD} will stall if its inputs |y|
and~|z| are not both known (namely if |y.p!=NULL| or |z.p!=NULL|).
In fact, it will also stall if its third input rA is not known;
the current speculative value of rA, except for its event bits,
is represented in the |ra|~field of the control block, and we must
have |ra.p==NULL|. In such a case the ALU will look to see if the
\&{spec} values pointed to by |y.p| and/or |z.p| and/or |ra.p| become
defined on this clock cycle, and it will update its own input values
accordingly.

But let's assume that |y|, |z|, and |ra| are already known at time 1002.
Then |x.o| will be set to |y.o+z.o| and |x.known| will become~|true|.
This will make the result destined for~l[1] available to be used in other
commands at time~1003.

If no overflow occurs when adding |y.o| to |z.o|, the |interrupt| and
|arith_exc| fields of the control block for \.{ADD} are set to zero.  But when
overflow does occur (shudder), there are two cases, based on the V-enable bit
of rA, which is found in field |b.o| of the control block. If this bit is~0,
the V-bit of the |arith_exc| field in the control block is set to~1; the
|arith_exc| field will be ored into~rA when the \.{ADD} instruction is
eventually committed.  But if the V-enable bit is~1, the trip handler should
be called, interrupting the normal sequence. In such a case, the |interrupt|
field of the control block is set to specify a trip, and the fetcher and
dispatcher are told to forget what they have been doing; all instructions
following the \.{ADD} in the reorder buffer must now be deissued. The virtual starting
address of the overflow trip handler, namely location~32, is hastily passed to
the fetch routine, and instructions will be fetched from that location
as soon as possible. (Of course the overflow and the trip handler are
still speculative until the \.{ADD} instruction is committed. Other exceptional
conditions might cause the \.{ADD} itself to be terminated before it
gets to the hot seat. But the pipeline keeps charging ahead, always trying to
guess the most probable outcome.)

The commission unit of this simulator is able to commit and/or deissue up to
|commit_max| instructions on each clock cycle. With luck, fewer than
|commit_max| instructions will be ahead of our \.{ADD} instruction at
time~1003, and they will all be completed normally. Then l[1]~can be set
to |x.o|, and the event bits of~rA can be updated from |arith_exc|,
and the \.{ADD} command can pass through the hot seat and out of the
reorder buffer.

Extern int fetch_max, dispatch_max, peekahead, commit_max;
 /* limits on instructions that can be handled per clock cycle */

@ The instruction currently occupying the hot seat is the only
issued-but-not-yet-committed instruction that is guaranteed to be truly
essential to the machine's computation. All other instructions in the reorder
buffer are being executed on speculation; if they prove to be needed, well and
good, but we might want to jettison them all if, say, an external interrupt
occurs.

Thus all instructions that change the global state in complicated ways---like
\.{LDVTS}, which changes the virtual address translation caches---are
performed only when they reach the hot seat. Fortunately the vast majority
of instructions are sufficiently simple that we can deal with them more
efficiently while other computations are taking place.

In this implementation the reorder buffer is simply housed in an array of
control records. The first array element is |reorder_bot|, and the last is
|reorder_top|. Variable |hot| points to the control block in the hot seat, and
|hot-1| to its predecessor, etc. Variable |cool| points to the next control
block that will be filled in the reorder buffer. If |hot==cool| the reorder
buffer is empty; otherwise it contains the control records |hot|, |hot-1|,
\dots,~|cool+1|, except of course that we wrap around from |reorder_bot| to
|reorder_top| when moving down in the buffer.

@* The dispatch stage. It would be nice to present the parts of this simulator
by dealing with the fetching, dispatching, executing, and committing
stages in that order. After all, instructions are first fetched,
then dispatched, then executed, and finally committed.
However, the fetch stage depends heavily on difficult questions of
memory management that are best deferred until we have looked at
the simpler parts of simulation. Therefore we will take our initial
plunge into the details of this program by looking first at the dispatch phase,
assuming that instructions have somehow appeared magically in the fetch buffer.

The fetch buffer, like the circular priority queue of all coroutines
and the circular queue used for the reorder buffer, lives in an
array that is best regarded as a ring of elements. The elements
are structures of type \&{fetch}, which have five fields:
A 32-bit |inst|, which is an \MMIX\ instruction; a 64-bit |loc|,
which is the virtual address of that instruction; an |interrupt| field,
which is nonzero if, for example, the protection bits in the relevant page
table entry for this address do not permit execution access; a boolean
|noted| field, which becomes |true| after the dispatch unit has peeked
at the instruction to see whether it is a jump or probable branch;
and a |hist| field, which records the recent branch history.
(The least significant bits of~|hist| correspond to the most recent branches.)

@<Type...@>=
typedef struct {
  octa loc; /* virtual address of instruction */
  tetra inst; /* the instruction itself */
  unsigned int interrupt; /* bit codes that might cause interruption */
  bool noted; /* have we peeked at this instruction? */
  unsigned int hist; /* if we peeked, this was the |peek_hist| */
} fetch;

@ The oldest and youngest entries in the fetch buffer are pointed
to by |head| and |tail|, just as the oldest and youngest entries in the
reorder buffer are called |hot| and |cool|. The fetch coroutine will
be adding entries at the |tail| position, which starts at |old_tail|
when a cycle begins, in parallel with the actions simulated by
the dispatcher. Therefore the dispatcher is allowed to look only at
instructions in |head|, |head-1|, \dots,~|old_tail+1|, although a few
more recently fetched instructions will usually be present in the fetch
buffer by the time this part of the program is executed.

      print_coroutine_id(((control*)inst_ptr.p->up)->owner);
    else print_specnode_id(inst_ptr.p->addr);

@ The best way to understand the dispatching process is once again
to ``think big,'' by imagining a huge fetch buffer and the
@^thinking big@>
potential ability to issue dozens of instructions per cycle, although
the actual numbers are typically quite small.

If the fetch buffer is not empty after |dispatch_max| instructions have
been dispatched, the dispatcher also looks at up to |peekahead| further
instructions to see if they are jumps or other commands that change the
flow of control. Much of this action would happen in parallel on a
real machine, but our simulator works sequentially.

In the following program, |true_head| records the head of the fetch buffer as
instructions are actually dispatched, while |head| refers to the position
currently being examined (possibly peeking into the future).

If the fetch buffer is empty at the beginning of the current clock
cycle, a ``dispatch bypass'' allows the dispatcher to issue the
first instruction that enters the fetch buffer on this cycle. Otherwise
the dispatcher is restricted to previously fetched instructions.

@ At any given time the simulated machine is in two main states, the
``hot state'' corresponding to instructions that have been committed and the
``cool state'' corresponding to all the speculative changes currently
being considered. The dispatcher works with cool instructions and puts them
into the reorder buffer, where they gradually get warmer and warmer.
Intermediate instructions, between |hot| and |cool|, have intermediate
temperatures.

A machine register like l[101] or g[250] is represented by a specnode whose
|o|~field is the current hot value of the register. If the |up| and |down|
fields of this specnode point to the node itself,
the hot and cool values of the register are
identical. Otherwise |up| and |down| are pointers to the coolest and hottest
ends of a doubly linked list of specnodes, representing intermediate
speculative values (sometimes called ``rename registers'').
@^rename registers@>
The rename registers are implemented as the |x| or~|a| specnodes inside control
blocks, for speculative instructions that use this register as a
destination. Speculative instructions that use the register as a
source operand point to the next-hottest specnode on the list, until
the value becomes known. The doubly linked list of specnodes is an
input-restricted deque: A node is inserted at the cool end when the
dispatcher issues an instruction with this register as destination;
a node is removed from the cool end if an instruction needs to be deissued;
a node is removed from the hot end when an instruction is committed.

The special registers rA, rB, \dots\ occupy the same array as the
global registers g[32], g[33], \dots~\thinspace. For example,
rB is internally the same as g[0], because |rB=0|.

are negative; memory addresses are positive.

and rN, which has a constant value identifying the time of compilation.
(The macro \.{ABSTIME} is defined externally in the file \.{abstime.h},

a trivial program that computes the value of the standard library function
|time(NULL)|. We assume that this number, which is the number of seconds in
the ``{\mc UNIX} epoch,'' is less than~$2^{32}$. Beware: Our assumption will
fail in February of 2106.)

@ Some special registers are so central to \MMIX's operation, they are
carried along with each control block in the reorder buffer instead of being
treated as source and destination registers of each instruction. For example,
the register stack pointers rO and~rS are treated in this way.
The normal specnodes for rO and~rS, namely |g[rO]| and~|g[rS]|,
are not actually used;
the cool values are called |cool_O| and |cool_S|.
(Actually |cool_O| and |cool_S| correspond to the register
values divided by~8, since rO and~rS are always multiples of~8.)

The arithmetic status register, rA, is also treated specially. Its
event bits are kept up to date only at the ``hot'' end, by accumulating
values of |arith_exc|; an instruction
to \.{GET} the value of~rA will be executed only in the hot seat.
The other bits of~rA, which are needed to control trip handlers and
floating point rounding, are treated in the normal way.

@ It's tempting to say that we could avoid taking up space in the reorder
buffer when no operation needs to be done.
A \.{JMP} instruction qualifies as a no-op in this sense,
because the change of control occurs before the execution stage.
However, even a no-op might have to be counted in the usage register~rU,
so it might get into the execution stage for that reason.
A no-op can also cause a protection interrupt, if it appears in a negative
location. Even more importantly, a program might get into a loop that consists
entirely of jumps and no-ops; then we wouldn't be able to interrupt it,
because the interruption mechanism needs to find the current location
in the reorder buffer! At least one functional unit therefore needs to provide
explicit support for \.{JMP}, \.{JMPB}, and \.{SWYM}.

The \.{SWYM} instruction with |F_BIT| set is a special case: This is
a request from the fetch coroutine for an update to the IT-cache,
when the page table method isn't implemented in hardware.

@* The execution stages. \MMIX's {\it raison d'\^etre\/} is its ability
to execute instructions. So now we want to simulate the behavior of its
functional units.

Each coroutine scheduled for action at the current tick of the clock has a
|stage| number corresponding to a particular subset of the \MMIX\ hardware.
For example, the coroutines with |stage=2| are the second stages in the
pipelines of the functional units. A coroutine with |stage=0| works
in the fetch unit. Several artificially large stage numbers
are used to control special coroutines that do things like write data
from buffers into memory.

In this program the current coroutine of interest is called |self|; hence
|self->stage| is the current stage number of interest. Another key variable,
|self->ctl|, is called~|data|; this is the control block being operated on by
the current coroutine. We typically are simulating an operation in which
|data->x| is being computed as a function of |data->y| and |data->z|.
The |data| record has many fields, as described earlier when we defined
\&{control} structures; for example, |data->owner| is the same as
|self|, during the execution stage, if it is nonnull.

This part of the simulator is written as if each functional unit is able to
handle all 256 operations. In practice, of course, a functional unit tends to
be much more specialized; the actual specialization is governed by the
dispatcher, which issues an instruction only to a functional unit that
supports it. Once an instruction has been dispatched, however, we can simulate
it most easily if we imagine that its functional unit is universal.

Coroutines with higher |stage| numbers are processed first.
The three most important variables that govern a coroutine's behavior, once
|self->stage| is given, are the external operation code |data->op|, the
internal operation code |data->i|, and the value of |data->state|. We
typically have |data->state=0| when a coroutine is first fired~up.

@ When a coroutine has done all it wants to on a single cycle,
it says |goto done|. It will not be scheduled to do any further work
unless the |schedule| routine has been called since it began execution.
The |wait| macro is a convenient way to say ``Please schedule me to resume
again at the current |data->state|'' after a specified time; for example,
|wait(1)| will restart a coroutine on the next clock tick.

@ Simple register-to-register instructions like \.{ADD} are assumed to take
just one cycle, but others like \.{FADD} almost certainly require more time.
This simulator can be configured so that \.{FADD} might take, say, four
pipeline stages of one cycle each ($1+1+1+1$), or two pipeline stages of two
cycles each ($2+2$), or a single unpipelined stage lasting four cycles (4),
etc. In any case the simulator computes the results now, for simplicity,
placing them in |data->x| and possibly also in |data->a| and/or
|data->interrupt|. The results will not be officially made |known| until

Suppose the pipeline sequence is $t_1+t_2+\cdots+t_k$. Each $t_j$ is
positive and less than~256, so we represent the sequence as a
string |pipe_seq[data->i]| of unsigned ``characters,'' terminated by~0.

\dots; wait $t_{k-1}$ cycles and pass |data| to stage~$k$; wait $t_k$ cycles

from time to time our speculation is incorrect and we must deissue
a sequence of instructions that prove to be unwanted. Deissuing must
take priority over committing, because the dispatcher cannot do anything
until the machine's cool state has stabilized.

Deissuing changes the cool state by undoing the most recently issued
instructions, in reverse order. Committing changes the hot state by
doing the least recently issued instructions, in their original order.
Both operations are similar, so we assume that they take the same time;
at most |commit_max| instructions are deissued and/or committed on
each clock cycle.

@* Branch prediction. An \MMIX\ programmer distinguishes statically between
``branches'' and ``probable branches,'' but many modern computers attempt to
do better by implementing dynamic branch prediction. (See, for example,
section~4.3 of Hennessy and Patterson's {\sl Computer Architecture},
second edition.) Experience has shown that dynamic branch prediction can
@^Hennessy, John LeRoy@>
@^Patterson, David Andrew@>
significantly improve the performance of speculative execution, by
reducing the number of instructions that need to be deissued.

This simulator has an optional |bp_table| containing $2^{\mkern1mua+b+c}$ entries of
$n$~bits each, where $n$ is between 1 and~8. Usually $n$ is 1 or~2 in
practice, but 8 bits are allocated per entry for convenience in this program.
The |bp_table| is consulted and updated on every branch instruction
(every \.{B}~or \.{PB} instruction, but not~\.{JMP}), for advice on
past history of similar situations. It is indexed by the $a$ least
significant bits of the address of the instruction, the $b$ most recent
bits of global branch history, and the next $c$ bits of both address
and history (exclusive-ored).

A |bp_table| entry begins at zero and is regarded as a signed $n$-bit number.
If it is nonnegative, we will follow the prediction in the instruction,
namely to predict a branch taken only in the \.{PB} case. If it is
negative, we will predict the opposite of the instruction's recommendation.
The $n$-bit number is increased (if possible) if the instruction's
prediction was correct, decreased (if possible) if the instruction's
prediction was incorrect.

(Incidentally, a large value of~$n$ is not necessarily a good idea.
For example, if $n=8$ the machine might need 128 steps to
recognize that a branch taken the first 150 times is not taken
the next 150 times. And if we modify the update criteria to avoid this
problem, we obtain a scheme that is rarely better than a simple scheme
with smaller~$n$.)

The values $a$, $b$, $c$, and $n$ in this discussion are called
|bp_a|, |bp_b|, |bp_c|, and |bp_n| in the program.

@* Cache memory. It's time now to consider \MMIX's MMU, the memory management
unit. This part of the machine deals with the critical problem of getting data
to and from the computational units. In a RISC architecture all interaction
between main memory and the computer registers is specified by load and store
instructions; thus memory accesses are much easier to deal with than they
would be on a machine with more complex kinds of interaction. But memory
management is still difficult, if we want to do it well, because main memory
typically operates at a much slower speed than the registers do. High-speed
implementations of \MMIX\ introduce intermediate ``caches'' of storage in
order to keep the most important data accessible, and cache maintenance can be
complicated when all the details are taken into account.
(See, for example, Chapter 5 of Hennessy and Patterson's
{\sl Computer Architecture}, second edition.)
@^Hennessy, John LeRoy@>
@^Patterson, David Andrew@>
@^caches@>

This simulator can be configured to have up to three auxiliary caches between
registers and memory: An I-cache for instructions, a D-cache for data, and an
S-cache for both instructions and data. The S-cache, also called a {\it
secondary cache}, is supported only if both I-cache and D-cache are present.
Arbitrary access times for each cache can be specified independently;
we might assume, for example, that data items in the I-cache or D-cache can
be sent to a register in one or two clock cycles, but the access time for the
S-cache might be say 5 cycles, and main memory might require 20 cycles or more.
Our speculative pipeline can have many functional units handling load
and store instructions, but only one load or store instruction can be
updating the D-cache or S-cache or main memory at a time. (However, the
D-cache can have several read ports; furthermore, data might
be passing between the S-cache and memory while other data is passing
between the reorder buffer and the D-cache.)

Besides the optional I-cache, D-cache, and S-cache, there are required caches
called the IT-cache and DT-cache, for translation of virtual addresses to
physical addresses. A translation cache is often called a ``translation
@^TLB@>
@^translation caches@>
lookaside buffer'' or TLB; but we call it a cache since it is implemented in
nearly the same way as an I-cache.

@ Consider a cache that has blocks of $2^b$~bytes each and
associativity~$2^a$; here $b\ge3$ and $a\ge0$. The I-cache, D-cache, and
S-cache are addressed by 48-bit physical addresses, as if they were part of
main memory; but the IT and DT caches are addressed by 64-bit keys, obtained
from a virtual address by blanking out the lower $s$ bits and inserting the
value of~$n$, where the page size~$s$ and the process number~$n$ are found
in~rV. We will consider all caches to be addressed by 64-bit keys, so that
both cases are handled with the same basic methods.

Given a 64-bit key,
we ignore the low-order $b$~bits and use the next $c$~bits
to address the {\it cache set\/}; then the remaining $64-b-c$ bits should
match one of $2^a$ {\it tags\/} in that set. The case $a=0$ corresponds to a
so-called {\it direct-mapped\/} cache; the case $c=0$ corresponds to a
so-called {\it fully associative\/} cache. With $2^c$ sets of $2^a$ blocks
each, and $2^b$ bytes per block, the cache contains $2^{a+b+c}$ bytes of data,
in addition to the space needed for tags. Translation caches have $b=3$ and
they also usually have $c=0$.

If a tag matches the specified bits, we ``hit'' in the cache and can
use and/or update the data found there. Otherwise we ``miss,'' and 
we probably want to replace one of the cache blocks by the block containing
the item sought. The item chosen for replacement is called a {\it victim}.
The choice of victim is forced when the cache is direct-mapped, but four
strategies for victim selection are available when we must choose from
among $2^a$ entries for $a>0$:

\smallskip\textindent{$\bullet$} ``Random'' selection chooses the victim
by extracting the least significant $a$~bits of the clock.

\smallskip\textindent{$\bullet$} ``Serial'' selection chooses 0, 1, \dots,
$2^a-1$, 0, 1, \dots, $2^a-1$, 0, \dots~on successive trials.

\smallskip\textindent{$\bullet$} ``LRU (Least Recently Used)'' selection
chooses the victim that ranks last if items are ranked inversely to the time
that has elapsed since their previous use.

\smallskip\textindent{$\bullet$} ``Pseudo-LRU'' selection chooses the
victim by a rough approximation to LRU that is simpler to implement
in hardware. It requires a bit table $r_1\ldots r_{2^a-1}$.
Whenever we use an item
with binary address $(i_1\ldots i_a)_2$ in the set, we adjust the
bit table as follows:
$$r_1\gets1-i_1,\quad r_{1i_1}\gets1-i_2,\quad\ldots,\quad
r_{1i_1\ldots i_{a-1}}\gets1-i_a;$$
here the subscripts on~$r$ are binary numbers. (For example, when $a=3$,
the use of element $(010)_2$ sets $r_1\gets1$, $r_{10}\gets0$, $r_{101}\gets1$,
where $r_{101}$ means the same as $r_5$.) To select a victim, we start with
$l\gets1$ and then repeatedly set $l\gets2l+r_l$, $a$~times; then we
choose element $l-2^a$. When $a=1$, this scheme is equivalent to LRU.
When $a=2$, this scheme was implemented in the Intel 80486 chip.

@<Type...@>=
typedef enum {@!random,@!serial,@!pseudo_lru,@!lru} replace_policy;

@ A cache might also include a ``victim'' area, which contains the
last $2^v$ victim blocks removed from the main cache area. The victim
area can be searched in parallel with the specified cache set, thereby
increasing the chance of a hit without making the search go slower.
Each of the three replacement policies can be used also in the victim cache.

@ A cache also has a {\it granularity\/} $2^g$, where $b\ge g\ge3$.  This
means that we maintain, for each cache block, a set of $2^{b-g}$ ``dirty
bits,'' which identify the $2^g$-byte groups that have possibly changed since
they were last read from memory. Thus if $g=b$, an entire cache block is
either dirty or clean; if $g=3$, the dirtiness of each octabyte is maintained
separately.

Two policies are available when new data is written into all or part
of a cache block. We can {\it write-through}, meaning that we send all new data
to memory immediately and never mark anything dirty; or we can {\it
write-back}, meaning that we update the memory from the cache only when
absolutely necessary. Furthermore we can {\it write-allocate},
meaning that we keep the new data in the cache, even if the cache block being
written has to be fetched first because of a miss; or we can {\it
write-around}, meaning that we keep the new data only if it was part of an
existing cache block.

(In this discussion, ``memory'' is shorthand for ``the next level
of the memory hierarchy''; if there is an S-cache, the I-cache and
D-cache write new data to the S-cache, not directly to memory. The I-cache,
IT-cache, and DT-cache are read-only, so they do not need the facilities
discussed in this section. Moreover, the D-cache and S-cache can be assumed to
have the same granularity.)

structures that contain arrays of \&{cacheblock} structures
for the individual blocks. We use a full byte to store each |dirty| bit,
and we use full integer words to store |rank| fields for LRU processing, etc.;

@ The |alloc_slot| routine is called when we wish to put new information
into a cache after a cache miss. It returns a pointer to a cache block
in the main area where the new information should be put. The tag of
that cache block is invalidated; the calling routine should take care
of filling it and giving it a valid tag in due time. The cache's |filler|
routine should not be active when |alloc_slot| is called.

Inserting new information might also require writing old information
into the next level of the memory hierarchy, if the block being replaced
is dirty. This routine returns |NULL| in such cases if the cache is
flushing a previously discarded block.
Otherwise it schedules the |flusher| coroutine.

This routine returns |NULL| also if the given key happens to be in the
cache. Such cases are rare, but the following scenario shows that
they aren't impossible: Suppose the DT-cache access time is 5, the D-cache
access time is~1, and two processes simultaneously look for the
same physical address. One process hits in DT-cache but misses in D-cache,
waiting 5 cycles before trying |alloc_slot| in the D-cache; meanwhile
the other process missed in D-cache but didn't need to use the DT-cache,
so it might have updated the D-cache.

A key value is never negative. Therefore we can invalidate the tag in
the chosen slot by forcing it to be negative.

@* Simulated memory. How should we deal with the potentially gigantic
memory of~\MMIX? We can't simply declare an array~$m$ that has
$2^{48}$ bytes. (Indeed, up to $2^{63}$ bytes are needed, if we
consider also the physical addresses $\ge2^{48}$ that are reserved for
memory-mapped input/output.)

We could regard memory as a special kind of cache,
in which every access is required to hit. For example, such an ``M-cache''
could be fully associative, with $2^a$ blocks each
having a different tag; simulation could proceed until more than~$2^a-1$ tags
are required. But then the predefined value of~$a$ might well be so large that
the sequential search of our |cache_search| routine would be too slow.

Instead, we will allocate memory in chunks of $2^{16}$ bytes at a time,
as needed, and we will use hashing to search for the relevant chunk
whenever a physical address is given. If the address is $2^{48}$ or greater,
special routines called |spec_read| and |spec_write|, supplied by the
user, will be called upon to do the reading or writing. Otherwise
the 48-bit address consists of a 32-bit {\it chunk address\/} and a
16-bit {\it chunk offset}.

Chunk addresses that are not used take no space in this simulator. But if,
say, 1000 such patterns occur, the simulator will dynamically allocate
approximately 65MB for the portions of main memory that are used.
Parameter |mem_chunks_max| specifies the largest number of different chunk
addresses that are supported. This parameter does not constrain the range of
simulated physical addresses, which cover the entire 256 large-terabyte range
permitted by~\MMIX.

the value zero is returned, optionally with a comment to the user.

Chunk address 0 is always allocated first. Then we can assume that
a matching chunk tag implies a nonnull |chunk| pointer.

This routine sets |last_h| to the chunk found, so that we can rapidly read
other words that we know must belong to the same chunk. For this purpose
it is convenient to let |mem_hash[hash_prime]| be a chunk full of zeros,

When such a coroutine is started, its |data->ptr_a| will be |Scache|

@* Cache transfers. We have seen that the |Dcache->flusher| sends
data directly to the main memory if there is no S-cache.
But if both D-cache and S-cache exist, the |Dcache->flusher| is a
more complicated coroutine of type |flush_to_S|. In this case we need
to deal with the fact that the S-cache blocks might be larger than
the D-cache blocks; furthermore, the S-cache might have a
write-around and/or write-through policy, etc. But one simplifying
fact does help us: We know that the flusher coroutine will not be
aborted until it has run to completion.

Some machines, such as the Alpha 21164, have an additional cache between
the S-cache and memory, called the B-cache (the ``backup cache''). A B-cache
could be simulated by extending the logic used here; but such extensions
of the present program are left to the interested reader.

@ The S-cache gets new data from memory by invoking a |fill_from_mem|
coroutine; the I-cache or D-cache may also invoke a |fill_from_mem| coroutine,
if there is no S-cache. When such a coroutine is invoked, it holds
|mem_lock|, and its caller has gone to sleep.
A physical memory address is given in |data->z.o|,
and |data->ptr_a| specifies either |Icache| or |Dcache|.
Furthermore, |data->ptr_b| specifies a block within that
cache, determined by the |alloc_slot| routine. The coroutine
simulates reading the contents of the specified memory location,
places the result in the |x.o| field of its caller's control block,
and wakes up the caller. It proceeds to fill the cache's |inbuf| and,
ultimately, the specified cache block, before waking the caller again.

Let |c=data->ptr_b|. The caller is then |c->fill_lock|, if this variable is
nonnull. However, the caller might not wish to be awoken or to receive
the data (for example, if it has been aborted). In such cases |c->fill_lock|
will be~|NULL|; the filling action continues without the wakeup calls.
If |c=Scache|, the S-cache will be locked and the caller will not
have been aborted.

\dots, into the cache if it is not too busy.

@ Another coroutine, called |cleanup|, is occasionally called into
action to remove dirty data from the D-cache and S-cache. If it is
invoked by starting in state 0, with its |i| field set to |sync|, it
will clean everything. It can also be
invoked in state~4, with its |i| field set to |syncd| and with a physical
address in its |z.o| field; then it simply makes sure that no D-cache
or S-cache blocks associated with that address are dirty.

Field |x.o.h| should be set to zero if items are expected to remain
in the cache after being cleaned; otherwise field |x.o.h| should be
set to |sign_bit|.

The coroutine that invokes |cleanup| should hold |clean_lock|. If that
coroutine dies, because of an interruption, the |cleanup| coroutine
will terminate prematurely.

We assume that the D-cache and S-cache have some sort of way to
identify their first dirty block, if any, in |access_time| cycles.

@* Virtual address translation. Special arrays of coroutines and control
blocks come into play when we need to implement \MMIX's rather complicated
page table mechanism for virtual address translation. In effect, we have up to
ten control blocks {\it outside\/} of the reorder buffer that are capable of
executing instructions just as if they were part of that buffer. The
``opcodes'' of these non-abortable instructions are special internal
operations called |ldptp| and |ldpte|, for loading page table pointers and
page table entries.

Suppose, for example, that we need to translate a virtual address for the
DT-cache in which the virtual page address $(a_4a_3a_2a_1a_0)_{1024}$ of
segment~$i$ has $a_4=a_3=0$ and $a_2\ne0$. Then the rules say that we should
first find a page table pointer $p_2$ in physical location
$2^{13}(r+b_i+2)+8a_2$, then another page table pointer~$p_1$ in location
$p_2+8a_1$, and finally the page table entry~$p_0$ in location $p_1+8a_0$. The
simulator achieves this by setting up three coroutines $c_0$, $c_1$, $c_2$
whose control blocks correspond to the pseudo-instructions
$$\vbox{\halign{\tt#\hfil\cr
LDPTP $x$,[$2^{63}+2^{13}(r+b_i+2)$],$8a_2$\cr
LDPTP $x$,$x$,$8a_1$\cr
LDPTE $x$,$x$,$8a_0$\cr}}$$
where $x$ is a hidden internal register and the other quantities are immediate
values. Slight changes to the normal functionality of \.{LDO} give us the
actions needed to implement \.{LDPTP} and \.{LDPTE}. Coroutine~$c_j$
corresponds to the instruction that involves $a_j$ and computes~$p_j$; when
$c_0$ has computed its value~$p_0$, we know how to translate the original
virtual address.

The \.{LDPTP} and \.{LDPTE} commands return zero
if their $y$~operand is zero or if the page table does not properly match~rV.

A virtual address is supplied in |data->y.o|, and |data->ptr_a| points
to a cache (|ITcache| or |DTcache|), while |data->ptr_b| is a block in that
cache. We wake up the caller, who holds the cache's |fill_lock|, as soon as

@* The write buffer. The dispatcher has arranged things so that speculative
stores into memory are recorded in a doubly linked list leading upward from
|mem|. When such instructions finally are committed, they enter the ``write
buffer,'' which holds octabytes that are ready to be written into designated
physical memory addresses (or into the D-cache and/or S-cache). The ``hot
state'' of the computation is reflected not only by the registers and caches
but also by the instructions that are pending in the write buffer.

@ The |write_search| routine looks to see if any instructions ahead of a given
place in the |mem| list of the reorder buffer are storing into a given
physical address, or if there's a pending instruction in the write buffer for
that address. If so, it returns a pointer to the value to be written. If not,
it returns~|NULL|. If the answer is currently unknown, because at least one
possibly relevant physical address has not yet been computed, the subroutine
returns the special code value~|DUNNO|.

The search starts at the |x.up| field of a control block for a store
instruction, otherwise at the |ptr_a| field of the control block,
unless |ptr_a| points to a committed instruction.

The |i| field in the write buffer is usually |st| or |pst|, inherited from
a store or partial store command. It may also be |sync| (from \.{SYNC}~\.1
or \.{SYNC}~\.3) or |stunc| (from \.{STUNC}).

@ When we're committing new data to memory, we can update an existing item in
the write buffer if it has the same physical address, unless that item is
already in the process of being written out. Increasing the value of
|holding_time| will increase the chance that this economy is possible, but
it will also increase the number of buffered items when writes are to
different locations.

A store instruction that sets any of the eight interrupt bits
\.{rwxnkbsp} will not affect memory, even if it doesn't cause an interrupt.

When ``store'' is followed by ``store uncached'' at the same address,

@* Loading and storing. A RISC machine is often said to have a ``load/store
architecture,'' perhaps because loading and storing are among the most
difficult things a RISC machine is called upon to do.

We want memory accesses
to be efficient, so we try to access the D-cache at the same time as we are
translating a virtual address via the DT-cache. Usually we hit in both
caches, but numerous cases must be dealt with when we miss. Is there
an elegant way to handle all the contingencies? Alas, the author of this
program was unable to think of anything better than to throw lots
of code at the problem --- knowing full well that such a spaghetti-like
approach is fraught with possibilities for error.

Instructions like \.{LDO} $x,y,z$ operate in two pipeline stages. The first
stage computes the virtual address $y+z$, waiting if necessary until $y$
and~$z$ are both known; then it starts to access the necessary caches.
In the second stage we ascertain the corresponding physical address and
hopefully find the data in the cache (or in the speculative |mem| list or the
write buffer).

An instruction like \.{STB} $x,y,z$ shares some of the computation of
\.{LDO}~$x,y,z$, because only one byte is being stored but the other seven
bytes must be found in the cache. In this case, however, $x$~is treated as an
input, and |mem| is the output. The second stage of a store command can begin
even though $x$ is not known during the first stage.

Here's what we do at the beginning of stage~1.

@ When stage 2 of a load/store command begins, the state will depend
on what transpired in stage~1.
For example, |data->state| will be |DT_miss| if the virtual address key
can't be found in the DT-cache; then stage~2 will have to compute the
physical address the hard way.

The |data->state| will be |DT_hit| if
the physical address is known via the DT-cache, but the data may or may not
be in the D-cache. The |data->state| will be |hit_and_miss| if the DT-cache
hits and the D-cache doesn't. And |data->state| will be |ld_ready| if
|data->x.o| is the desired octabyte (for example, if both caches hit).

can try to make them the same by ``page coloring'' whenever possible.) If both
caches hit, the physical address is known in

If the lower $b+c$ bits of the virtual and physical addresses differ,
the machine will not know this until the DT-cache has hit.

@ The second stage might also want to fill the D-cache (and perhaps
the S-cache) as we get the data.

Several load instructions might be trying to fill the same cache block.
So we should go back and look in the D-cache again if we miss and
cannot allocate a slot immediately.

A \.{PRELD} or \.{PREST} instruction, which is just a ``hint,'' doesn't do
anything more if the caches are already busy.

@* The fetch stage. Now that we've mastered the most difficult memory
operations, we can relax and apply our knowledge to the slightly simpler task
of filling the fetch buffer. Fetching is like loading/storing, except that we
use the I-cache instead of the D-cache. It's slightly simpler because the
I-cache is read-only. Further simplifications would be possible if there
were no \.{PREGO} instruction, because there is only one fetch unit.
However, we want to implement \.{PREGO} with reasonable efficiency, in order
to see if that instruction is worthwhile; so we include the complications of
simultaneous I-cache and IT-cache readers, which we
have already implemented for the D-cache and DT-cache.

The fetch coroutine is always present, as the one and only coroutine with
|stage| number~zero.

In normal circumstances, the fetch coroutine accesses a cache block containing
the instruction whose virtual address is given by |inst_ptr| (the instruction
pointer), and transfers up to |fetch_max| instructions from that block to the
fetch buffer. Complications arise if the instruction isn't in the cache, or if
we can't translate the virtual address because of a miss in the IT-cache.
Moreover, |inst_ptr| is a \&{spec} variable whose value might not even be
known; if |inst_ptr.p| is nonnull, we don't know what to fetch.

the most recently fetched octabytes in positions |fetch_lo|, |fetch_lo+1|,
\dots, |fetch_hi-1| of a buffer called |fetched|. Once that buffer has been
exhausted, the coroutine reverts to state~0; with luck, the buffer might have
more data by the time the next cycle rolls around.

@* Interrupts. The scariest thing about the design of a pipelined machine is
the existence of interrupts, which disrupt the smooth flow of a computation in
ways that are difficult to anticipate. Fortunately, however, the discipline of
a reorder buffer, which forces instructions to be committed in order,
allows us to deal with interrupts in a fairly natural way. Our solution to the
problems of dynamic scheduling and speculative execution therefore solves the
interrupt problem as well.
@^interrupts@>

\MMIX\ has three kinds of interrupts, which show up as bit codes in the
|interrupt| field when an instruction is ready to be committed:
|H_BIT| invokes a trip handler, for \.{TRIP} instructions and
arithmetic exceptions; |F_BIT| invokes a forced-trap handler, for \.{TRAP}
instructions and unimplemented instructions that need to be emulated
in software; |E_BIT| invokes a dynamic-trap handler, for external
interrupts like I/O signals or for internal interrupts caused by
improper instructions.
In all three cases, the pipeline control has already been redirected to fetch
new instructions starting at the correct handler address by the time an
interrupted instruction is ready to be committed.

@ Most instructions come to the following part of the program, if they
have finished execution with any~1s among the eight trip bits or the
eight trap bits.

If the trip bits aren't all zero, we want to update the event bits
of~rA, or perform an enabled trip handler, or both. If the trap bits
are nonzero, we need to hold onto them until we get to the hot seat,
when they will be joined with the bits of~rQ and probably cause an interrupt.
A load or store instruction with nonzero trap bits will be nullified,
not committed.

Underflow that is exact and not enabled is ignored, in accordance with
the IEEE standard conventions. (This applies also to underflow
triggered by |RESUME_SET|.)

@ Whew; we've successfully interrupted the computation. The remaining
task is to restart it again, as transparently as possible.

The \.{RESUME} instruction waits for the pipeline to drain, because
it has to do such drastic things. For example, an interrupt may be
occurring at this very moment, changing the registers needed for resumption.

and we'd lose the operand values for |RESUME_SET| or |RESUME_CONT|.)

A subtle point arises here: If |RESUME_TRANS| is being used to compute
the page translation of virtual address zero, we don't want to execute
the dummy \.{SWYM} instruction from virtual address $-4$! So we avoid

\.{UNSAVE}~$1,rB,z-96$; \.{UNSAVE}~$2,255,z-104$; \.{UNSAVE}~$2,254,z-112$;
etc. If an interrupt occurs before these instructions have all been committed,
the execution register will contain enough information to restart the process.

After the global registers have all been loaded, \.{UNSAVE} continues by
acting rather like~\.{POP}. An interrupt occurring during this last stage
will find $\rm rS<rO$; a context switch might then take us back to
restoring the local registers again. But no information will be lost,

@ The conditional set (\.{CS}) instructions are, rather surprisingly,
more difficult to implement than the zero~set (\.{ZS}) instructions,
although the \.{ZS} instructions do more. The reason is that dynamic
instruction dependencies are more complicated with \.{CS}. Consider, for
example, the instructions
$$\advance\abovedisplayskip-.5\baselineskip
  \advance\belowdisplayskip-.5\baselineskip
\hbox{\tt LDO x,a,b; \ FDIV y,c,d; \ CSZ y,x,0; \ INCL y,1.}$$
If the value of \.x is zero, the \.{INCL} instruction need not wait for the
division to be completed. (We do not, however, abort the division in such a
case; it might invoke a trip handler, or change the inexact bit, etc. Our
policy is to treat common cases efficiently and to treat all cases correctly,
but not to treat all cases with maximum efficiency.)

@* System operations. Finally we need to implement some operations for the
operating system; then the hardware simulation will be done!

A \.{LDVTS} instruction is delayed until it reaches the hot seat, because
it changes the IT and DT caches. The operating system should use \.{SYNC}
after \.{LDVTS} if the effects are needed immediately; the system is also
responsible for ensuring that the page table permission bits agree with
the \.{LDVTS} permission bits when the latter are nonzero. (Also, if
write permission is taken away from a page, the operating system must
have previously used \.{SYNCD} to write out any dirty bytes that might
have been cached from that page; \.{SYNCD} will be inoperative after write
permission goes away.)

@ The \.{SYNC} operation interacts with the pipeline in interesting ways.
\.{SYNC}~\.0 and \.{SYNC}~\.4 are the simplest; they just lock the
dispatch and wait until they get to the hot seat, after which the
pipeline has drained. \.{SYNC}~\.1 and \.{SYNC}~\.3 put a ``barrier''
into the write buffer so that subsequent store instructions will not merge with
previous stores. \.{SYNC}~\.2 and \.{SYNC}~\.3 lock the dispatch until
all previous load instructions have left the pipeline. \.{SYNC}~\.5,
\.{SYNC}~\.6, and \.{SYNC}~\.7 remove things from caches once they
get to the hot seat.

bytes we are supposed to be syncing; |data->b.o.l| is the number of
bytes we can handle at once (either |Icache->bb| or |Dcache->bb| or 8192).

We need a more elaborate scheme to implement \.{SYNCD} and \.{SYNCID}
than we have used for the ``hint'' instructions \.{PRELD}, \.{PREGO},
and \.{PREST}, because \.{SYNCD} and \.{SYNCID} are not merely hints.
They cannot be converted into a sequence of cache-block-size commands at
dispatch time, because we cannot be sure that the starting virtual address
will be aligned with the beginning of a cache block. We need to realize
that the bytes specified by \.{SYNCD} or \.{SYNCID} might cross a
virtual page boundary---possibly with different protection bits
on each page. We need to allow for interrupts. And we also need to
keep the fetch buffer empty until a user's \.{SYNCID} has completely
brought the memory up to date.

@* Input and output. We're done implementing the hardware, but there's
still a small matter of software remaining, because we sometimes
want to pretend that a real operating
system is present without actually having one loaded. This simulator
therefore implements a special feature: If \.{RESUME}~\.1 is issued in
location~rT, the ten special I/O traps of {\mc MMIX-SIM} are performed
instantaneously behind the scenes.

Of course all claims of accurate simulation go out the door when this
feature is used.
