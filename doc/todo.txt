- CFLAGS has to be organized differently
- display cause of traps that are triggered by setting a bit in rQ
- give all modules init, reset and shutdown, even if they are empty?
- the naming of static functions should be consistent
- atm its possible to use a program to load something to arbitrary devices (at least theoretically)
- reset and shutdown-function for cli-commands?
- show more information when resetting (size of ROM, ...)
- we should arrange things, so that the build-date (rN) is refreshed
