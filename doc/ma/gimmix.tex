\chapter{The Implementation of GIMMIX}

Now that the entire MMIX architecture has been explained, the simulator GIMMIX should be described in detail. As already mentioned in the introduction, GIMMIX has been developed with the goal to be able to port an operating system to it. Therefore GIMMIX pursues to be correct (which implies to be not more complex than necessary), implement MMIX completely and offer a convenient and productive user interface, so that an OS can be debugged.

This chapter splits the depiction of GIMMIX into five parts. At first, the design decisions for the implementation are explained, followed by an overview of the simulator. Subsequently, the implementation of the MMIX architecture (the "core") is described in detail and yet existing devices are introduced shortly. Finally, the command line interface (CLI), which allows it to debug an OS or arbitrary other programs for MMIX, is presented.
