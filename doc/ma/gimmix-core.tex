\section{Simulator Core}

This section describes the most important part of the simulator, \ie the implementation of the MMIX architecture.

\subsection{Structure}

The following figure breaks the core, that has been displayed as a black box in the previous \gls{FMC} diagram, further down into pieces:

\noindent That means, it consists of four parts: \i{CPU}, \i{MMU}, \i{cache} and \i{bus}, whereas requests are always done from left to right. For example, when using \mi{LDO} to read an octa from main memory (RAM, which is a device as well), the load instruction will request it from the MMU, which might have to translate the virtual address to a physical one first. Subsequently, the MMU will send a request to the cache to read an octa from the obtained physical address. If it is not in the data cache yet, the cache will send a request to the bus, which in turn will find the associated device and forward the request to it. Finally, the RAM device reads the octa from main memory and the result is passed back, ending at the load instruction.

The CPU consists of several parts as well. It has a module named \i{decoder}, which obviously is responsible for decoding an instruction. Additionally, the module \i{instr} implements all MMIX instructions, using \i{int} and \i{float} for integer and floating point arithmetic, respectively. Finally, the module \i{register} realizes the register stack.

The different parts shown in the diagram are explained in more detail in the following sections.
